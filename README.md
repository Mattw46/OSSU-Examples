# Important note:
This repo is not affiated with OSSU in anyway.
This is to track my personal growth using these free resources.

Here I am following the Computer Science curriculum (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). I have previous experience in Computer Science but have become rusty and using this resource to refresh the fundatmentals.

*Organisation:*
The code is organised by Section > Course. Languages will vary depending the the langauged perscribed.

*Sections*

*Further Notes:*
Students are encouraged to focus on an area of choice later in the guide.
Although I'm well aware of options and previously been web focused I'm looking to be open to new areas to focus.
